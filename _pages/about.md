Welcome to GreenSys Website!

The rapid growth of Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) applications has introduced significant sustainability challenges. These advanced computational models, with their intensive processing and data requirements, have substantially increased energy consumption in IT infrastructure, leading to a larger carbon footprint.

The sustainability of large-scale AI systems is particularly challenging due to the diversity in hardware architectures, software stacks, and model complexities. This variability necessitates innovative approaches to enhance energy and carbon efficiency throughout AI modelâ€™s lifecycle. Addressing these challenges requires advancements in AI algorithms, hardware, and runtime systems overseeing complex cyber-physical infrastructures. Solutions must be data-driven and incorporate cross-layer optimization across models, hardware, software stacks, and energy sources. Additionally, they should also enable automated energy consumption measurement and inform effective design and deployment strategies. 

This workshop aims to foster dialogue between systems and AI researchers to identify solutions to key sustainability challenges in AI, ensuring a more sustainable future for AI development and deployment.
