We invite contributions to the workshop proceedings. The workshop aims to provide a platform for authors to present work in progress or early-stage research within this domain. Presenters are encouraged to share ongoing projects, fostering constructive feedback and stimulating dialogue. This interactive setting will promote collaboration among participants, including the audience and distinguished researchers delivering invited talks.

## Topics

We invite authors to submit research contributions across all areas of sustainable AI. Topics of interest include energy-aware training and inference methods, carbon-conscious large-scale AI systems, and studies analyzing the environmental impacts of AI—such as water usage, energy consumption, and carbon footprints. We also welcome work on platforms and architectures designed for sustainable computing. Specific topics include, but are not limited to

- Sustainable AI Systems
- Energy-Efficient AIOps
- Power-Aware Workload Management
- Dynamic Inference Orchestration
- Hardware-Software Co-design Methods
- AI on Resource-Constrained Edge Devices
- Data Center Optimizations for AI Workloads
- Analysis of Environmental impact of AI (Energy, Water, and Carbon Footprints)
- Software Engineering Practices for Energy-Aware AI
- Carbon-Aware LLM Lifecycle Management



## Submission Guidelines


Authors are invited to submit original and unpublished research papers to GreenSys '26 describing work that is not currently under review at other venues. We especially welcome innovative, early-stage ideas and preliminary results.

Submissions must be formatted as PDF files using the latest ACM sigconf proceedings template (10-pt font, double-column) and **must not exceed 6 pages**, including references. This workshop follows a single-blind review process; therefore, the first page must include author names, affiliations, and contact information.

All submissions will undergo independent peer review, and accepted papers will be published in the ACM Digital Library. 

Submissions must be done electronically via HotCRP [https://greensys26.hotcrp.com/](https://greensys26.hotcrp.com/)
<!-- All submissions will be reviewed by the reviwers committee with the aim to accept all qualifying submissions subject to ability to accommodate them in the program. If needed, priority will be given to submissions according to their fit with the scope of the workshop. --> 

## Attendance and Presentation

Please note that at least one author of each accepted paper is required to register and present the work at the workshop for it to be included in the proceedings. 

<!-- The articles will be listed in the workshop program and GreenSys 2026 participants will have access to the corresponding abstracts and a link to the original journal article. -->
