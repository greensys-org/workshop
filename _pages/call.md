We invite submissions for the journal-first track. The goal of these presentations is to provide authors with the opportunity to share their journal work that has not yet been publicly presented. Additionally, presenters are encouraged to discuss their ongoing projects. This will allow them to receive feedback and foster interactions and collaborations with other participants, including authors and distinguished researchers delivering invited talks.

## Topics
Authors are invited to submit their journal publication research manuscripts in all areas of sustainable AI, energy-aware training and inference principles, carbon-aware large-scale AI systems, and platforms and architectures for sustainable computing.

Specific topics include, but are not limited to:

- Sustainable AI
- Energy-efficient AI MLOps
- Power and Carbon-aware workload Management
- Data Center Optimizations
- Carbon-aware LLM Life Cycle Management
- Software engineering practices for energy-aware AI
- AI for energy-efficient systems
- ...

- DOI of the original publication or, alternatively, a link to the publication at the journalâ€™s website.

## Evaluation

All submissions will be reviewed by the organizing committee with the aim to accept all qualifying submissions subject to
ability to accommodate them in the program. If needed, priority will be given to submissions according to their topical fit with the scope of the workshop.

## Attendance and Presentation

At least one author of each submission accepted must register and attend the workshop to present the article.
The author needs a workshop registration to present the journal article.

Since the articles have already been published, they will not be part of the EuroSys or ASPLOS proceedings.

The articles will be listed in the workshop program and GreenSys 2025 participants will have access to the corresponding abstracts and a link to the original journal article.
