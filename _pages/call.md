We invite submissions for the journal-first track. The goal of these presentations is to provide authors with the opportunity to share their journal work that has not yet been publicly presented. Additionally, presenters are encouraged to discuss their ongoing projects. This will allow them to receive feedback and foster interactions and collaborations with other participants, including authors and distinguished researchers delivering invited talks.

## Topics
Authors are invited to submit their journal publication research manuscripts in all areas of sustainable AI, energy-aware training and inference principles, carbon-aware large-scale AI systems, and platforms and architectures for sustainable computing. Specific topics include, but are not limited to:

- Sustainable AI
- Energy-efficient AI MLOps
- Power and Carbon-aware workload Management
- Data Center Optimizations
- Carbon-aware LLM Life Cycle Management
- Software engineering practices for energy-aware AI
- AI for energy-efficient systems
- ...
